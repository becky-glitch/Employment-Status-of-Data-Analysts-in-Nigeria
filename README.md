## Objective
To gain actionable insights into:
* The major obstacles data analysts face on their journey to employment
* The most-used tools and their link to employment outcomes
* The role of internships and academic background in job placement
* The average time-to-employment after beginning a data journey
* The salary expectations for data analysts at entry level

## Key Questions Explored
* What are the biggest challenges Nigerian data analysts face in getting hired?
* Which tools are more common among employed analysts compared to unemployed ones?
* Does internship experience influence job acquisition?
* Which fields of study yield the highest employment rates?
* How long does it typically take to land a data analyst job after starting?
* What salary ranges are common for entry-level positions?

## Tools Used
* Microsoft Forms – for survey creation and data collection
* Microsoft Excel – for data cleaning and preparation
* Power BI – for interactive visualization and storytelling


## Key Insights (Data Storytelling)
* Out of the 110 data analysts surveyed, only 21 were employed, showing that less than 1 in 5 had successfully broken into the workforce at the time of data collection.
* Interestingly, 109 of the 110 respondents reported using Excel, making it the most common tool across the board. However, among the 21 employed analysts, a clear pattern emerged: those who had mastery in Excel, SQL, and Power BI were significantly more likely to be employed, suggesting that tool diversity is a major factor in employability.
* When it comes to challenges, the top two issues reported were:
Lack of real-world projects
Lack of mentorship
* These challenges were echoed by both employed and unemployed respondents and appear to be the biggest barriers preventing analysts from transitioning from learning to earning. Despite many having technical knowledge, the absence of practical experience and guidance continues to hinder job readiness.
* Respondents with backgrounds in Computer Science, Engineering, or other STEM fields had slightly higher employment rates, though this was not a guarantee. Those without internships were only marginally disadvantaged, indicating that while internships help, they aren’t the only factor.
* Time-to-employment data showed that most employed analysts got jobs within 6 to 12 months of starting their data journey. Entry-level salary expectations clustered around ₦100,000 – ₦300,000/month, although a few outliers reported higher figures.

## Recommendations

### **Problem 1: Lack of Real-World Projects**

**Recommendation:**
* **Start personal projects** using publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle, data.gov.ng, World Bank).
* Pick problems around you — e.g., fuel scarcity trends, rent prices, unemployment rates — and analyze them.
* Share your work on GitHub and LinkedIn consistently to build credibility.
* Join **monthly challenges** like #MakeoverMonday or #PowerBIChallenge to practice and gain visibility.

### **Problem 2: Lack of Mentorship**

**Recommendation:**
* Reach out to data professionals on LinkedIn with a **short, polite message** asking for advice (not a job).
* Join active Nigerian data communities (e.g., **DataFestAfrica**, **Data Science Nigeria**, **Women in Data**).
* Attend free webinars and live sessions where experienced analysts give feedback on portfolios and projects.
* If possible, **pay for mentorship** via platforms like ADAN, Utiva, or through micro-coaching from experts.

### **Problem 3: Tool Knowledge Gaps (SQL, Excel, Power BI)**

**Recommendation:**
* Use **free YouTube tutorials** or courses (e.g., your own channel or LinkedIn Learning trials) to build skills in the top 3 tools: **Excel, SQL, Power BI**.
* Focus on **building simple dashboards**, writing **basic SQL queries**, and mastering **Excel functions** like VLOOKUP, IF, and PivotTables.
* Build a **"Tool Mastery Tracker"** where you document new things you learn weekly and apply them in mini-projects.

### **Problem 4: Difficulty Gaining Internships or Jobs**

**Recommendation:**
* Build a **strong LinkedIn profile** with portfolio links, personal projects, and a clear "About Me" section.
* Target **entry-level or internship roles on Jobberman, LinkedIn Jobs, MyJobMag**, and tech startup groups.
* Write a **short case study** or story behind each project you do and post it online — employers notice this!
* Volunteer to analyze data for small NGOs, churches, schools, or startups to gain real experience.

### **Problem 5: Low Networking Opportunities**

**Recommendation:**
* **Comment** meaningfully on posts from other data analysts on LinkedIn — it increases visibility.
* Join virtual communities on **Telegram, WhatsApp**, or Slack where data discussions happen.
* Attend tech meetups or webinars hosted by **tech hubs** in your city — even as an observer.
* Consider **hosting a beginner data webinar or IG live**, even if just to review one of your projects. This builds confidence and community.
